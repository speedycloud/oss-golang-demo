## 创建桶接口示例 (CreateBucket)

This implementation of the PUT operation creates a new bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid AWS Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.
